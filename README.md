# Gradient-Descent-Scratch-LR-
Here I have implemented the Linear Regression Algorithm from scratch,for minimizing the Cost Function I have used Gradient Descent Technique,using Gradient Descent I found out the best values of the parameters for which the cost function is minimized,by fitting these parameters in our equation of line,we get the best fit line.The Mean Squared Error is only 7.0 which is excellent

**Note:I usually visualize my data by using Plotly Library,so if you are having trouble viewing them in the GitHub viewer, you are free to clone my repository on your local machine and check them out in jupyter notebook.
